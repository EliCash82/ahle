# Anderson's HyperLit Engine (AHLE) 

### About the Project

Anderson's HyperLit Engine or AHLE is a template for creating
exploration/ludic based summaries of literature written in Ruby. 

By creating a map, and placing characters from a specific narratives
(or topic-objects from any form of codex) in different places within 
the map, readers can enhance comprehesion and build deeper engagement
with texts as *PLAYERS* or approach the Ruby language and the computer
command-line as *BUILDERS*.
