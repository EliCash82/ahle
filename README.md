# Anderson's HyperLit Engine (AHLE) 

### About the Project

Anderson's HyperLit Engine or AHLE is a template for creating
exploration/ludic based summaries of literature written in Ruby. 

By creating a map, and placing characters from a specific narratives
(or topic-objects from any form of codex) in different places within 
the map, readers can enhance comprehesion and build deeper engagement
with texts as "PLAYERS" or approach the Ruby language and the computer
command-line as "BUILDERS."
